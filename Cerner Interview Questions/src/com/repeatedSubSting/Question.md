Given a string ‘str’, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

Examples:

Input: str = "abcabcabc"
Output: true
The given string is 3 times repetition of "abc"

Input: str = "abadabad"
Output: true
The given string is 2 times repetition of "abad"

Input: str = "aabaabaabaab"
Output: true
The given string is 4 times repetition of "aab"

Input: str = "abcdabc"
Output: false

Solution:
There can be many solutions to this problem. The challenging part is to solve the problem in O(n) time. Below is a O(n) algorithm.

Let the given string be ‘str’ and length of given string be ‘n’.


1) Find length of the longest proper prefix of ‘str’ which is also a suffix. Let the length of the longest proper prefix suffix be ‘len’. This can be computed in O(n) time using pre-processing step of KMP string matching algorithm.

2) If value of ‘n – len’ divides n (or ‘n % (n-len)’ is 0), then return true, else return false.

In case of ‘true’ , the substring ‘str[0..n-len-1]’ is the substring that repeats n%(n-len) times.

Let us take few examples.

Input: str = “ABCDABCD”, n = 8 (Number of characters in ‘str’)
The value of len is 4 (“ABCD” is the longest substring which is both prefix and suffix)
Since (n-len) divides n, the answer is true.

Input: str = “ABCDABC”, n = 7 (Number of characters in ‘str’)
The value of len is 3 (“ABC” is the longest substring which is both prefix and suffix)
Since (n-len) doesn’t divides n, the answer is false.

Input: str = “ABCABCABCABCABC”, n = 15 (Number of characters in ‘str’)
The value of len is 12 (“ABCABCABCABC” is the longest substring which is both prefix and suffix)
Since (n-len) divides n, the answer is true.

How does this work?
length of longest proper prefix-suffix (or len) is always between 0 to n-1. If len is n-1, then all characters in string are same. For example len is 3 for “AAAA”. If len is n-2 and n is even, then two characters in string repeat n/2 times. For example “ABABABAB”, length of lps is 6. The reason is if the first n-2 characters are same as last n-2 character, the starting from the first pair, every pair of characters is identical to the next pair. The following diagram demonstrates same for substring of length 4.
